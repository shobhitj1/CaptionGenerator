# CaptionGenerator
Nowadays we find that systems are becoming smarter
because of the amalgamation of AI with technology. In this
research paper, the idea of generating Image captions with
the use of CNN and RNN (LSTM) technology is being
introduced to the readers. The model presented over here is
trained on Flickr 8k, which is a small dataset capable of
running on systems with the basic specification. The model
presented here attempts to solve the problem, whereby
heavy machinery is required to implement an AI model.
Through the paper, we have experienced how Keras
Xception (CNN model) and the recurrent neural network
system can be used to extract the image features. Further,
these image features work as an input for the LSTM model,
helping it generate the captions. Most importantly, these
captions will be provided as voice output, with the use of
the Google-Text-to-Speech module.
